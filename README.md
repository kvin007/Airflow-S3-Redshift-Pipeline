# ELT pipeline using S3, Redshift and Airflow

The DAG is designed to perform an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process by loading and transforming data from an S3 data lake into Redshift using Airflow. The DAG is scheduled to run hourly and is set to not catch up on any missed schedules

## Technology Stack

1. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: S3 is used as the data lake to store raw data. It provides scalable and durable object storage, allowing for easy data ingestion and storage. S3's flexibility and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal choice for staging data before loading it into Redshift.

2. **AWS Redshift**: Redshift serves as the data warehousing solution for this ETL process. It is a fully managed data warehouse service that offers fast query performance and can handle large-scale data sets. Redshift's columnar storage and parallel processing capabilities make it well-suited for analytical workloads.

3. **Apache Airflow**: Airflow is used as the orchestrator for the ETL workflow. It allows for the definition, scheduling, and monitoring of complex workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Airflow's rich ecosystem of operators and integrations makes it a powerful tool for data pipeline automation.

## Benefits of the Technology Stack

- **Scalability**: Using S3 as the data lake and Redshift as the data warehouse provides a highly scalable solution. S3 can handle virtually unlimited data, and Redshift can scale to accommodate growing data volumes.

- **Performance**: Redshift's columnar storage and parallel processing architecture enable fast query performance, making it suitable for analytical queries on large datasets. This ensures efficient data processing and analysis.

- **Cost-effectiveness**: AWS S3 and Redshift offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they consume. This cost-effective approach is ideal for businesses of all sizes.

- **Flexibility**: S3 supports various data formats and allows users to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. This flexibility enables easy ingestion of different types of data into Redshift.

- **Data Integrity and Quality**: Airflow's "DataQualityOperator" is used to perform data quality checks on the fact and dimension tables. This ensures that the data loaded into Redshift is accurate and reliable.

- **Workflow Automation**: Apache Airflow provides a user-friendly interface for defining, scheduling, and monitoring complex data workflows. The "udac_example_dag" DAG automates the entire ETL process, reducing manual intervention and streamlining data processing.

- **Dependency Management**: Airflow DAGs allow for easy definition of task dependencies, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency throughout the ETL workflow.

## DAG Overview

The "udac_example_dag" DAG is responsible for orchestrating the entire ETL process. It starts with a dummy task called "Begin_execution" and ends with another dummy task called "Stop_execution." These dummy tasks act as the entry and exit points of the DAG.

The main steps of the DAG are as follows:

1. **Stage Data**: Two "StageToRedshiftOperator" tasks are used to load data from S3 into staging tables in Redshift. One task loads log data from the "udacity-dend" S3 bucket, and the other task loads song data from the same bucket.

2. **Load Fact Table**: The "LoadFactOperator" task is responsible for inserting data into the "songplays" fact table from the staging tables.

3. **Load Dimension Tables**: Four "LoadDimensionOperator" tasks are used to load data into dimension tables: "users," "songs," "artists," and "time." Each task executes the respective insert statements to populate the dimension tables.

4. **Run Data Quality Checks**: The "DataQualityOperator" task is responsible for running data quality checks on the fact and dimension tables. It executes a series of SQL test cases and compares the results with expected values to ensure data accuracy.

## Operators Overview

### StageToRedshiftOperator
This operator loads data from S3 into Redshift staging tables. It uses AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket and the Redshift connection to execute the COPY command for data ingestion.

### LoadFactOperator
This operator is responsible for loading data from staging tables into the "songplays" fact table. It executes the appropriate insert statement to append data to the fact table.

### LoadDimensionOperator
This operator is used to load data from staging tables into dimension tables. It executes the appropriate insert statement to populate the dimension table. It supports two insert modes: "truncate" and "recreate."

### DataQualityOperator
The DataQualityOperator runs data quality checks on fact and dimension tables. It executes SQL test cases to validate the data's integrity, ensuring the expected results match the actual results.

## Configuration and Scheduling

The DAG is configured with default arguments such as the owner, start date, retries, and retry delay. It is scheduled to run hourly, starting from January 12, 2019, and does not catch up on any missed schedules.

Note: The AWS credentials (AWS_KEY and AWS_SECRET) used in the DAG are commented out. Ensure you have the appropriate AWS credentials set up in your Airflow environment.
